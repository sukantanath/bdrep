TOTAL RESOURCES:
180 nodes
each node 20 cores
each node 100GB ram

1 core, 1GB for hadoop & os - so each node 19 core and 99GB ram

JOB PARAMETER CALCULATIION:

number of cores = 5 (works best as per industry standard)

number of executors
executor per node = 19 core per node/5 cores ~ 4 executor per node

total executor = 4*180 = 720 (take 10% of that) ~ 72 executor 

memory for each executor 

memory per executor = memory in 1 node / executor in 1 node = 99 / 4 ~ 25GB (take half) ~ 12 GB

memory over head = 12 * 0.07 = .84GB ~ 850MB
 so 12 - .84 ~ 11 GB
